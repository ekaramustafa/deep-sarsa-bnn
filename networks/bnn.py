This layer can be used for both in linear and convolutional neural networks.
Therefore, the output_dim and n_actions should be modified and used accordingly.
This setup is for using linear layers in CNNs.

The input to the neural network consists is an 84 x 84 x 4 image produced by Ï†. 
The first hidden layer convolves 16 8 x 8 filters with stride 4 with the input image 
and applies a rectifier nonlinearity [10, 18]. The second hidden layer 
convolves 32 4 x 4 filters with stride 2, again followed by a rectifier nonlinearity. 
The final hidden layer is fully-connected and consists of 256 rectifier units. 
The output layer is a fully-connected linear layer with a single output for each valid action. 
The number of valid actions varied between 4 and 18 on the games we considered.
