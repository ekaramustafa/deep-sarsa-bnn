# Deep Expected SARSA using Bayesian Neural Network 
Environment: gymnasium atari 

This project aims to address the limitations of off-policy methods, such as overestimation, by incorporating on-policy methods, specifically Deep Expected SARSA. Additionally, it incorporates Bayesian Neural Networks to further mitigate the effects of overestimation.
