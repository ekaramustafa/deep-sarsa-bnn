# Deep Expected SARSA using Bayesian Neural Network 
Environment: gymnasium atari 

This project aims to address the limitations of off-policy methods such as overestimation using on-policy methods particularly Deep Expected SARSA. It also incorporates Bayesian Neural Network to further reduce the effect of overestimation.
